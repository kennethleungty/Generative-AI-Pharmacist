# Macy the AI Pharmacist, created with Generative AI

## Introduction
Presenting to you, **Macy the AI Pharmacist**! 

Eager to put generative AI tools to the test, I created this animated avatar capable of delivering medication counselling in a realistic and professional-sounding manner.

Click the thumbnail to watch the video to see Macy in action, where she briefly talks about two commonly-prescribed medications.

The outcome is impressive and will only get better very quickly, given the speed at which generative AI is improving.

To create this virtual pharmacist, it took me 0 dollars and 25 minutes, with the help of these tools:

1. [**Midjourney**](https://midjourney.com/home/?callbackUrl=%2Fapp%2F) to generate an image of a female pharmacist
2. [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to generate script for medication counselling
3. [**ElevenLabs**](http://www.elevenlabs.io/) to generate audio from the ChatGPT script
4. [**D-ID**](https://www.d-id.com/) to generate realistic animated avatar video synced with audio (Free trial)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### (1) Midjourney - Image Generation
- We need a face to represent our avatar, and we can use image generation tools to do just that
- Midjourney is a free AI service by OpenAI that creates images from textual descriptions
- Setup:
    1. Midjourney works entirely on Discord, so make sure you sign up for a Discord account (which is free).
    2. Visit this Midjourney site [link](https://discord.gg/midjourney), which automatically takes you to a Discord invite.
    3. Accept the Discord invite to Midjourney. Choose to Continue to Discord.

- Note: I also tried DALL-E but the faces I got were not very realistic (e.g., misaligned facial features). I did not try Stable Diffusion though.
