 Hi, my name is Macy and I am a licensed pharmacist. It's nice to meet you. Today, I would like to go over your new prescription with you and provide you with some important counselling points. The prescription you have been given includes Metformin 1 tablet three times a day, Amlodipine 1 tablet every morning, and Aspirin 1 tablet every morning.

Firstly, let's talk about Metformin. This medication is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by lowering the amount of sugar in your blood. It is important that you take this medication with food, as it can cause an upset stomach if taken on an empty stomach. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that this medication can cause low blood sugar, so make sure to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly.

Next, let's discuss Amlodipine. This medication is used to treat high blood pressure. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. It is important that you take this medication at the same time every day. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the potential side effects of this medication, such as dizziness and swelling in your feet or ankles. If you experience any of these symptoms, please let your doctor know.

Finally, let's talk about Aspirin. This medication is used to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke. It works by preventing blood clots from forming. It is important to take this medication with a full glass of water and with food. Additionally, it is important to be aware that this medication can increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you have a history of stomach ulcers. If you experience any unusual bleeding or bruising, please let your doctor know.

In conclusion, it is important to take all of your medications as directed by your doctor. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or your doctor for further clarification. Thank you for allowing me to counsel you on your new prescription.
